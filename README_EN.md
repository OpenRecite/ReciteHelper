ReciteHelper is an open-source Windows desktop application for exam preparation, course learning, and knowledge organisation. It uses AI to read study materials, extract knowledge, and generate questions. A local knowledge base, automatic grading, mistake explanations, and personalised FSRS-6 scheduling then turn those materials into a complete learning loop.

AI is not an isolated chat box in ReciteHelper. It participates in document analysis, question generation, retrieval, and mistake assistance, while chapters, questions, learning records, and the vector knowledge base stay with the local project.

## 5.0 Lotus

Version 5.0 reorganises the experience around the path from source material to durable knowledge:

- **FSRS-6 review scheduling** predicts recall from difficulty, memory stability, and elapsed time, prioritising questions that are about to be forgotten. Personal parameters can be fitted after enough review history is available.
- **Five question types** provide dedicated interactions and grading for single-choice, fill-in-the-blank, true/false, term-definition, and essay questions.
- **Paper import and an end-to-end exam flow** recognise exam sets from PDF, TXT, HTML, or MHTML and support chapter-weighted generation, timed exams, automatic grading, and mistake review.
- **A project-local knowledge base** retrieves relevant knowledge for each mistake and can request a grounded AI explanation when needed.
- **Flexible model access** supports direct DeepSeek + Qwen access, a single OpenRouter key, or a ReciteHelper hosted-service activation code.

## Workflow

```text
Import course material → Extract knowledge and generate questions → Practise / take exams
       → Retrieve and explain mistakes → Schedule the next review with FSRS-6
```

## Model Services

When no valid model configuration is found, ReciteHelper opens a service-selection window on startup.

| Option | What you need | Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DeepSeek + Qwen | A DeepSeek key and a Qwen key | Direct text-generation and embedding access; usually faster |
| OpenRouter | One OpenRouter key | Simpler setup; chat and embeddings share one gateway, but may be slower |
| Hosted service | A ReciteHelper activation code | No third-party API keys to manage; model access is provided by the server |

API keys are stored in the local `Config.xml` by default and may also reference environment variables. Text required by an AI feature is sent to the model provider you select; project files and the vector knowledge base remain local.

## Quick Start

1. Download the latest build from [Releases](https://github.com/OpenRecite/ReciteHelper/releases).
2. Extract it and run `ReciteHelper.exe`.
3. Choose and configure a model service in the first-run window.
4. Import a text-based PDF, or merge DOCX, PPTX, PDF, and TXT material into a `.meg` file, then create a `.rhproj` learning project.

See the [English user guide](docs/manual-en.md) for complete setup and usage instructions.

## Build from Source

Install the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) and Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider with WPF support.

```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OpenRecite/ReciteHelper.git
cd ReciteHelper
dotnet restore src/ReciteHelper.slnx
dotnet build src/ReciteHelper.slnx --configuration Release
dotnet run --project ReciteHelper.Wpf/ReciteHelper.Wpf.csproj
```

If the repository was cloned without its submodules, run:

```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
